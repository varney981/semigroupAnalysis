# Reading semigroup tables
Each line corresponds to a Cayley table. One would read a table of order n by assigning the first n characters to the 1st row of the table. The next n characters would be assigned to the next row, and so on.

E.g: A,A,A,A,B,C,A,B,C

reads as

A A A         
A B C         
A B C 

and not 

A A A
A B B
A C C
